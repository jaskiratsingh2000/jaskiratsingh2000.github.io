            My contributions in open source.

          <p>
            My work in open source is a blend of passion and profession, centered on the belief that collaborative development can create powerful, accessible technology for everyone. My journey has been a multifaceted one: I began as a hands-on developer, evolved into a mentor guiding new contributors, and now focus on strategic research into the health and sustainability of open-source communities, where my background as a research scholar allows me to apply a uniquely analytical lens. 🔬 I leverage data-driven insights and methodical analysis to design evidence-based strategies that improve contributor retention and foster genuine engagement. 📈 This holistic perspective allows me to not only build innovative software but also to help cultivate the thriving, inclusive, and truly sustainable ecosystems required for long-term success. 🚀
